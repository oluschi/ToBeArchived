			<p>    My fashion sense is a unique blend of preppy and streetwear, which reflects my upbringing in the suburbs. Drawing inspiration from the conservative southern prep culture, I incorporate pieces like collared shirts, pleated mid-length skirts, and tailored blazers into my outfits. Additionally, I also love to infuse elements of sporty streetwear culture for a trendy and edgy vibe.
			<br><br>
			As a busy student pursuing my bachelor's degree, I find myself gravitating towards comfortable and casual wear on a daily basis. However, I make a conscious effort to elevate my look by incorporating prep culture elements into my styling. This not only adds a touch of sophistication but also shows my appreciation for classic fashion staples.
			<br><br>
			Overall, my style is a reflection of my personality and values - a unique and harmonious combination of tradition and modernity. </p>
